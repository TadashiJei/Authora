Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v20 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The application requires several environment variables to run correctly.
    - Copy the example environment file:
